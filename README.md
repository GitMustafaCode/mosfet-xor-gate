# MOSFET-Based XOR Gate

This project demonstrates the design, construction, and testing of a 2-input XOR logic gate using discrete MOSFET transistors. The XOR gate was built using transistor-level design methodology.

## üîß Objective

Design, build, and test a functional XOR logic gate entirely using MOSFET transistors on a breadboard. The circuit was analyzed for logical functionality, voltage levels, and timing performance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Schematic

The XOR gate was designed using 12 transistors from two **MC14007UB** ICs, following standard CMOS design practices. The schematic includes the PMOS and NMOS transistors arranged to realize the XOR logic truth table.

The transistors are labeled clearly, with pull-up and pull-down networks formed to handle each logic input combination correctly.

## ‚úÖ Functional Testing

The physical circuit was constructed on a breadboard and tested using an **Analog Discovery 2** (AD2) for input pattern generation and output analysis.

### Input-Output Patterns

Logic analyzer results confirmed the XOR functionality:

- Y = 0 when A = B (both 0 or both 1)
- Y = 1 when A ‚â† B

## üìâ Static Voltage Level Testing

To evaluate output voltage levels:

- One input (A) was fixed at 5V (logic HIGH)
- The other input (B) was toggled with a square wave (0-5V)
- The output (Y) was measured on an oscilloscope

### Results

- **VH (High):** ~5.05 V
- **VL (Low):** ~0 V
